0 a crass and insulting homage to great films like some like it hot and the john wayne classics 
0 an overwrought taiwanese soaper about three people and their mixed up relationship

1 both an admirable reconstruction of terrible events , and a fitting memorial to the dead of that day , and of the thousands thereafter

1 the film's snags and stumblings are more than compensated for by its wryly subversive tone 
1 it doesn't make for great cinema , but it is interesting to see where one's imagination will lead when given the opportunity 
0 could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes fatal attraction look like a classic by comparison ? that's the only sane rationale i can think of for swimfan's existence 
0 like the excruciating end of days , collateral damage presents schwarzenegger as a tragic figure , but sympathy really belongs with any viewer forced to watch him try out so many complicated facial expressions 
1 this movie has a strong message about never giving up on a loved one , but it's not an easy movie to watch and will probably disturb many who see it 
0 rather quickly , the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation 
0 gaping plot holes sink this'sub standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth 
0 i suspect that there are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject

1 a hugely rewarding experience that's every bit as enlightening , insightful and entertaining as grant's two best films four weddings and a funeral and bridget jones's diary 
1 a rich tale of our times , very well told with an appropriate minimum of means 
0 without shakespeare's eloquent language , the update is dreary and sluggish
