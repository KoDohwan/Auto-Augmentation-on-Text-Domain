0 i give it stars only because the installation process or rather problems that may surface during the installation process can be frustrating to the average computer user 
0 the flash is very weak 
1 to set up the box , wap , and ether nest bridge , with the encryption on was less then mins 
0 however after just one month my headphone jack was broken as a result of normal , every day use 
1 this is the first cell phone i've owned , and overall , i am quite pleased with it 
1 also , you can store data on it , which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , don't bother , this is a much better buy 
1 what i like the most small and solid feel 
0 after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than of the dvds i put in it 
1 sure , it slows it down a little , but that's expected 
0 what the g raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical 
1 i bought my zen micro three months ago mainly because i preferred the size and style to the ipod mini 
0 who wants to pay to discuss a defect in a product that just cost ? i also bought the back up cd 
1 as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine 
0 loading cds was somewhat time consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well 
1 if you need a wireless router get it get it get it works really good 
0 ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring 
0 the only way my pc internet works is if i open the firewall program configuration and manually refresh it 
1 speaker phone quality is good , and poping in a mb mmc card , it rocks ! 
0 it had a heavier and more sturdy casing 
0 the software sucks 
0 and if you're a mac user like me , they've naturally made sure you have no viable alternative 
0 even after reading some of the instructions , it's still hard to figure out 
1 with gb of storage i have about , songs on the player everything music file i have is on there with room for about , more 
1 i took it to my father's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him 
1 i compared it to other cd players two models of panasonic , rio samsung and they were no way even near zen micro 
1 memory storage seemingly boundless 
1 bottom line great product , unbeatable price 
1 autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all 
1 actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated 
1 other than this , i am very pleased with the router and would buy it again 
1 one outstanding positive feature is the battery it holds a charge for a long time , longer than most other similar products and the user can replace it easily or take another along as a backup 
0 cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners 
0 one downside as of this writing , t mobile hasn't updated their t zone system to fully support the 
0 as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand 
1 and it is very easy to clean 
1 once you set it up , it's great 
1 the best megapixel x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use 
1 it's overkill for simple snapshots , unless you've got way too much money to blow 
0 again , this is a design flaw in the headphone ! 
0 mb for a camera like this is a joke 
1 i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips , i give it stars oh and btw , while you take video clips , you can zoom it too ! digital zoom only though but still my old one can't do that you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip 
1 i am happy with the fact that i can use any bag in there and dont have to pay out the nose for replacements 
1 fits well in hand in trouser pockets 
1 here's the brief synopsis the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of plastic like as if it might break , but seems pretty sturdy 
1 you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of now playing interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical 
1 the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead 
1 the documentation is much better than the documentation that came with the b router i needed a lot of help from linksys technical assistance to set that one up 
1 the wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog 
1 the log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most easy of ways 
1 the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior 
1 the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise 
1 i recommend unreservedly the powershot g to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period ! 
1 the greatest thing about the software in my humble is that it reads your cd info 
1 the thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome ! 
0 can't say whether i rec'd an updated model but it will not read dvd rw's or vcd's for me 
1 also included in the games section is the great music trivia option which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs 
1 we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken 
1 i love the features on the ipod and the many things you can do with it 
1 overall i like the unit 
1 this is really a nice diaper pail 
0 i did it and it was worse the second time around unbelievable 
0 it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot 
0 i've had nokia's for years , and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use a phone 
1 the zen micro fm receiver is ok , not great 
1 i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about feet from my desk by accident as well as have played it outdoors in fahrenheit weather by design and it has continued to work fine 
1 i want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason 
1 it has a classic design yet looks hip 
1 it was a good player when it worked and i loved the design 
0 the only reason for not giving it stars the claimed battery life of hours is very optimistic possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for hours without ever touching the player , but in real life i can probably get hours at most 
0 it would just spin up and stop , and display no disc 
0 i never know when the champ is full as there is no way too tell even though not particularly aesthetic , how about making the champ clear and see through ? so , i lift the lid and find a wad of diaper , which i must remove , usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full 
0 well , my second one is now beginning to hi cup a bit after about years 
1 the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to 
0 the problems i had installing norton extended way beyond what symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with 
0 however , i am very disappointed with this product and with symantec 
1 can't beat carrying cd collection with me wherever i go 
1 awesome for the newbie , though i personally like to fasten every bolt myself 
1 overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it 
0 the only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment 
1 this camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation 
1 the remote capture and file viewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing 
0 the installation software cd crashed repeatedly 
1 another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it 
1 in auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera 
0 for example , in auto mode you can't use the flash redeye reduction , you must be in manual mode for that 
0 but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version 
1 great price 
1 took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it's a very user friendly player imo 
1 the package also comes with a usb cable , an ac adapter , a pair of headphones they're okay until you get a better pair , a stand , and a microfiber pouch to carry your zen touch in 
0 i have never had this problem with any other software on my computer 
0 b the screen is hard to read the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display 
1 the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road ! 
0 my main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag 
0 the included memory card is too small 
0 up , down , left , and right would have given me better control 
1 it powers up quickly , so you won't miss that quick shot 
1 as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better 
1 the included leather pouch is a big plus it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of carrying cases fail to do with other audio devices 
1 versatile and stylish 
1 i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer 
1 excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures 
1 at first i had a problem with some smell , then i realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in then there is no smell at all ! 
1 like it's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags , and excellent sound widely known to be better than ipod not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business 
1 despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box ! 
1 this is a wonderful camera 
0 on several different occasions it has displayed no disc with a disc inside 
0 the box included a little polyester , pull string bag , yes , you read right a bag , something a boy would carry ten marbles in and tries to pass it off as the case 
0 update january th the second one crapped out only after a week dont buy this product ! 
0 i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust 
1 size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you 
0 now in october , , the firewall said i couldn't ok anymore software to use the internet because its full 
0 however , it has failed to deliver on quality 
1 the battery is also convenient , but could have been better , such as the zen touch's battery but at least this one is removable 
1 this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it 
0 it's oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router , activate the chuck lock , and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up 
1 this year , it seems that i choose my timing perfectly , having discovered the awesome device that is the zen micro 
0 no problems now , just a sickly disappointment in the way norton has abandoned their customers 
0 they are a royal pain to install , and don't function properly once finally installed if you can install them at all 
1 the edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well 
1 my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money 
1 i have been very impressed with my purchase of the sd i bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot images so far with it 
1 i installed , activated and registered nis without issue 
1 i am impressed with this camera inside and out 
1 this is my fourth linksys product and , aside from the rough start , i'm very satisfied with this router 
1 this phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones 
1 i have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright 
1 i also own a retail store and this little guy easily plugs into my aux slot in the store's sound system 
0 i just uninstalled systemworks and internet security for at least the fifth time due to functionality issues 
1 i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since 
0 the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it i encode my songs at kbps without variable bit rates 
1 well backlit keypad 
1 and it fits right in my pocket much easier than my old s 
0 and the remote is cheap and ch easy not sure how long it'll last , but for bucks what the heck ! 
1 get it , it's woth every penny ! ! 
1 i have stored around cd's at kbps on this and have barely touched the available memory 
0 the biggest problem is the installation 
1 the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited 
1 if you're looking for a hp plunge router , the hitachi m v is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget 
1 it's shorter , sleeker , more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the ipod my nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy ! 
1 i received this little jewel as a gift and i can honestly say absolutely love it 
0 well , i got my second player , and right out of the box it wasn't working right and once again , after consulting customer se ! 
1 it practically plays almost everything you give it 
0 a cell phone is to make calls , in other words , quality of reception and mic speaker are the most important , the has a relatively low volume speaker , you'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet 
1 pi ii ghz mb rd ram windows xp pro gb hd i was able to uninstall nis and install nis with no trouble 
1 i like the size and weight of this little critter 
1 this router has soft start and runs smooth and true 
1 compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use 
0 but , the creative zen micro is plagued by a serious , serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw , and i'm going to tell you what it is but first , two more things about this piece of garbage that's so great and could've made it a potential ipod killer 
1 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , x optical and the fact that it carries nikon's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worth wile at the price 
1 i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine 
0 to address two previous somewhat negative reviews yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder 
1 overall , i've been very impressed with the player 
0 the front cover which you remove to take out the battery feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid 
1 enjoy 
1 works great ! 
1 the interface has a sassier flair and the blue lit trimming is an added bonus 
0 the only beef that i have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged 
1 colors variety of hot colors made it difficult to choose from 
1 the quality is significant and you'll be very happy from saving time and the headache 
0 i sent creative customer service emails in which they did not help me one bit and don't seem to even want to help 
0 multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like you'd expect 
0 the phone does not have an mp player , fm radio , k color screen , megapixel camera , quad band , pda , photo editor 
0 other than that it is all the same except the new updates 
1 it's still one of the smallest mp digital cameras on the market , and absolutely one of the best built most stylish cameras ever 
0 this is somewhat annoying , but from working with computers especially windows ugh 
0 i've since replaced it with a pair of black sennheisers not only are the packaged earbuds pretty uncomfortable , but are too similar to ipod's and can target ipod thieves here in nyc 
1 this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can't go wrong 
0 apple closed their island to anything that resembled microsoft , and clearly let napster know it could not use their products with napster's services 
1 i loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and , very importantly , the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous 
0 i find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much 
1 amazon is awesome ! 
1 despite a critical start , this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do which is pretty lofty does more than most does it well is dependable 
1 solid , high quality construction 
0 when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture ! 
1 it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones 
0 you can see the lens barrel in the view finder 
1 replacement battery is compared to ipod's 
1 this model appears to be especially good 
1 the phone offers a mb mmc card and i think that is certainly the most exciting feature 
0 the navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy 
1 this item is exceptional i like the ease of use and it held the odor in great 
0 in addition , i do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours , and it can take four hours for a full charge 
1 the hitachi is made in malaya , and looked cheap compared with the makita , which is made in the usa 
1 they were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything i have encountered 
1 great sound db signal to noise ratio beats ipod's unspecified ratio and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head phones as well as external speakers 
1 in addition it is very easy to setup 
1 you can use the player to store your computer data files good feature to have 
1 the first thing i did was upgrade the firmware to the version required for wmp , it syncs flawlessly with media player and transfers are fast 
1 i'm sure i don't use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers , but i really like it ! 
1 the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative 
0 the only downside i see is that it doesn't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer 
1 the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool 
1 it may not top the ipod mini , but it's definitely an alternative if you also want the extra features and good sound quality 
0 it was immediately noticeable that nis slows down my computer pent , ram 
1 storage capacity 
1 overall i like it 
0 it wouldn't always work seamlessly with wmp and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it 
0 after installation , the very first time i booted up the creative mediasource organizer , intending to use its cd burning and ripping functions , it totally shorted out 
0 this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues 
1 just bought one i've enjoyed it to date 
1 technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! ! 
1 i didn't read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive 
0 back in may , when i first reviewed this , it had taken me over hours to install and run 
1 it is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great 
1 drops and strong signals even from the backyard 
1 it looks really sleek and stylish , and does everything it claims 
1 i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not like my apartment 
1 the battery on mine lasts days if i don't play games that much , and it only takes mins to charge from flat 
0 in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side mounted volume control 
1 four megapixels is great 
1 the sound quality is very good 
0 also , the lens cap design is flawed 
1 another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i'd scanned before buying 
1 very good every day camera fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos 
0 it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light 
1 no offense to amazon , but i was able to find one online for just over bucks i'm sure prices here will continue to sink , and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space 
1 i really liked the price 
0 this isn't uncommon in cameras , though , just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries , you should be fine 
0 battery compared to the other players on the market , the ipod has one of the worst batteries around 
1 battery non issue 
1 ok , not quite everything but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it 
1 games not really important , but exist ant 
0 the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well 
1 it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing ! 
1 but this by far is the best phone out there right now ! 
1 the g is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds 
0 also , the instruction manual is very bad 
0 well , within days the video output quit working both rca optic 
1 excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jv players 
1 for a sleeker , smaller and more average mp player the nitrus is great but the ipod blows it out of the water the interface is great and the design is wonderful 
1 in conclusion , i gave the ipod a because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly 
1 moreover , apart from the plastic cable cover , the camera has a nice , solid feel about it , and it's so tiny , i take it with me wherever i go 
0 as for the zen micro cons i read that every button is touch sensitive , and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front 
1 i am a big fan of itunes , simply because it is terribly fast and convenient if you are buying the songs from the itunes site 
1 ball metaphor i was hoping creative hit a home run here , and i think the zen micro is more like a stand up double 
1 accessing files by artist and album i mostly look things up by artist is easy and intuitive 
0 the firmware has bugs too , so download and install the latest firmware from linksys 
1 all in all , this is a great phone 
1 but that is good for me because symantec soft wares are a bit hard to master for me who are not savvy on computers 
1 i am enjoying my phone a lot 
1 i love that you can create custom playlists , and organize music in so many different ways 
0 i spent hours setting up the stations accepts about , i believe , though the reception is unpredictable 
1 if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket , take great pics and video , get the sd 
1 easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot 
1 wish i could give it stars 
1 overall the ipod really is an almost flawless beast the capacity in the gb is more than i think most people would ever need and , for the price , i highly recommend it 
1 the best part about this router is now i have a dhaka server 
1 the signal to noise ratio the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave a larger stn ratio is better is nice and high at decibels , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods 
1 the pop up blocker and anti spam are bonuses 
1 its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i've seen 
1 the pictures are absolutely amazing the camera captures the minutest of details 
0 if you've been listening to cd's in your car for awhile , dealing with the drop off in sound quality may take some getting used to 
0 it's perfect for those who aren't planning on storing tons of music 
1 fact is , it couldn't be easier to use 
0 i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media 
0 it had locked up multiple times previously , but always managed to work after wards this time , the touch screen wouldn't respond to me and none of the buttons worked 
1 the setup was a breeze , i had some reservations about a wireless network see my review for linksys wet but this item was on sale as well as the wet so i just had to splurge 
1 its ability to serve as a back up for my music collection is a huge plus 
1 transferring files couldn't be easier thanks to the included software bundle 
0 since zen does not have an external antenna it has some problems catching weak signals but it works 
0 however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my dix rips 
1 if you love your cell phone games or changing your ring tones everyday , nokia beats everyone else 
1 i highly recommend this ! 
1 putting in mp player , lots of games and application to download 
1 the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent 
1 for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages 
0 it worked from to at which time the picture failed completely see other negative reviews my unit wasn't the only one this happened to 
1 it is light enough to carry around all day without bother 
1 overall , i'm giving this stars as i've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too 
1 we don't have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail ! 
0 its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket 
1 the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot 
1 the nokia is a decent extension of the smart phone line 
1 there are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact 
0 i've been bothered by blown out highlights on the s , and the g seems to do only slightly better 
1 well , it was nice while it lasted 
0 the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone else's is too 
1 we were able to obtain a norton corporate edition of antivirus only no firewall or utilities and so far it's great 
0 you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll 
0 cons breaks easily 
1 i use this with a home theater system and it's amazing how it sounds , the picture clarity is unmatched ! 
1 this phone is highly recommended otherwise 
1 there is an open source firmware on the net which has tons of extra features 
1 i use the scented bags and even if i don't no smell ! 
0 i would have liked to have given it stars docking that star only for the size 
0 while transferring songs to the player , the interface has crashed a few times times in a hour period normally this would cause me major concern , but it appears that this bug is reproducible , which leads me to believe that creative will fix it with a patched version shortly or maybe it's just my computer 
1 the pics can be touched up in photoshop , and be printed at x and they look great ! 
1 no need for deodorizers 
1 overall this is the best phone i have ever owned 
1 all the cool features of the mini , but with gb instead of 
1 but it takes gorgeous pictures for a mp camera 
0 the subscription files are still a little slower to transfer , but it's only by about or so 
0 when taking pictures of people , however , it shows every flaw in the subject's skin 
1 handsfree future is good , but not too exciting 
1 it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds 
1 the prints are beautiful ! 
1 then sorting the files is easy as pie 
1 sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products 
0 the biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousin's player was relatively new , it was riddled with scratches 
1 having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos 
1 this is quite simply the best you can ask for 
1 i've been using nis for about months and it works well 
1 in conclusion , this player is beautiful 
0 it doesn't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users don't generally have firewire cards themselves 
1 i also wanted to switch to broad com hardware which the linksys uses because my wifi menisci card in my dell laptop with lucien silicon in it used of my ghz laptop's cpu when using the wireless at full speed 
0 i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason 
1 uploading the images to my windows based pc is very fast and simple 
1 one good thing , it is gb of disk space well , it is gb in reality 
1 a decent piece of hardware with great speed i get the same speeds as with my comp connected directly to the modem and good signal quality 
0 nothing but hassle with this company 
1 simple to use and hook up 
0 i have trashed this product on other opinion sites based on this major flaw alone 
0 it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation 
1 pros large hard drive for the gb and gb are both affordable 
0 it would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die 
0 the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with canned air 
1 the software that comes with the digital elph is very nice and intuitive 
0 the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to 
1 the phone also sports an image gallery with option camera attachment , a calendar organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio way cool , even if it is just through an ear peice , games , java applications and gprs high speed internet connection 
1 i have transferred in about , tracks so far very easy to use both the ipod and itunes 
1 the color and light i captured with this camera on a day trip to turkey gorgeous vividly colored ceramic tiles inside darkened mosques were far superior to anything i've ever gotten with a traditional mm film camera 
1 i love having the option to manually control the f stop , shutter speed and even focus 
1 i have a hard time using other phones with smaller screens ! ! ! 
1 honestly , i love this player 
1 the camera is adequate and if i want high res photos i'll use my digital camera instead 
0 finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order 
0 the cut outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel 
1 the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies 
0 second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed 
1 i love the storage in this thing 
1 the player is smaller than you think 
0 the fine adjustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table 
0 after pictures total the lcd went black except for the icons showing the settings 
0 i then tried to set up the router through linksys's browser interface , but as the only instructions available tell you to use the installation cd , i had little luck i did manage to connect briefly , but the connection kept dropping , and with no idea of how to resolve that issue , i gave up 
1 the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit's size in doing so 
1 you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right 
1 the antivirus feature is phenomenal , and is regularly updated 
0 the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie extras on them on the two occasions when i tried to do that 
1 this phone has a nice blend of features without going overboard 
0 i try navigating to a chapter past via the menu and it wouldn't do it ! 
0 that is , you can not access the internet at all 
0 it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs , it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies 
0 it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot 
1 the included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well 
1 i purchased this camera before it went on sale , and while i wouldn't have minded keeping the extra , it was definitely worth it 
0 i'm giving it star because as compared to other nokia phones , its a , compared to other blunders by other companies such a samsung and motorola it might be good but if you're getting a nokia , don't get this one 
0 i'm giving it stars because the setup process was so miserable 
0 first , it failed whenever connecting to get updates 
1 the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon and is better than anything else i've seen 
0 i am annoyed that the player's not automatically recognized as a hard drive 
1 no skips , and it hasn't faltered once despite your inevitable drop or two 
0 other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better 
0 i tried to call norton , and the only numbers they list on their sites are either for non tech customer service tried this one and hung up after minute of muzak or they have a tech support number 
1 i love the rounded edges now , fits so much better in a pocket , jeans or suit 
1 this new click wheel ipod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch wheel for scrolling and click able buttons for selection 
1 the fit and finish of the product is first rate 
1 personally , i am very pleased with the diaper champ 
1 bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent 
1 excellent sound i mean the player has juice 
0 the hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as i am now using medium diapers i have a month old and they're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact i make then and how un soiled they are 
1 retraction said mine had silver plate it does have display 
0 software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i don't mind buying notmad 
1 band and you can just change the sim card in it to be able to use it in europe with another service provider 
1 i'm easily enlarging pictures to x with no vi sable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet super fine 
0 have tried to contact apex via e mail customerservice apexdigital com , but the e mail address is not valid 
0 shortly after i brought it , the plunging shafts started sticking 
0 one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough 
1 despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography 
0 the new hardware version does not run linux at all and most likely will not since the memory has been cut in half 
0 now there is one more complaint i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with a mbyte cf , which gives me raw images , as opposed to ! 
1 by no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it , just be able to put a cd in the computer and it tells you what to do 
0 on dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd 
0 i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous ! 
0 software music match jukebox isn't the greatest , the search function isn't fast even when accessing it with the hot key shortcut 
0 this is a terrible company with a bad product and awful support 
0 not compatible with audible com books 
0 my jpeg pictures are viewable not so sharp and vivid on my screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my monitor
