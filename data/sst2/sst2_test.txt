1 a tasty appetizer that leaves you wanting more 
1 the film delivers what it promises a look at the `` wild ride' that ensues when brash young men set out to conquer the online world with laptops , cell phones and sketchy business plans 
1 a bit of a downer and a little over dramatic at times , but this is a beautiful film for people who like their romances to have that french realism

0 a lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen loud , violent and mindless 
0 slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ? 
1 children may not understand everything that happens i'm not sure even miyazaki himself does but they will almost certainly be fascinated , and undoubtedly delighted 
1 it's worth seeing just on the basis of the wisdom , and at times , the startling optimism , of the children

1 ken russell would love this 
1 when all is said and done , she loves them to pieces and so , i trust , will you 
1 vera has created a provocative , absorbing drama that reveals the curse of a self hatred instilled by rigid social mores

0 it's hard to imagine any recent film , independent or otherwise , that makes as much of a mess as this one 
0 this ludicrous film is predictable at every turn 
1 the film is exhilarating to watch because sandler , liberated from the constraints of formula , reveals unexpected depths as an actor 
1 a beautifully observed character piece 
0 nothing more or less than an outright bodice ripper it should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows 
0 even by the intentionally low standards of frat boy humor , sorority boys is a bowser 
0 it's all surface psychodramatics 
1 a gentle blend of present day testimonials , surviving footage of burstein and his family performing , historical archives , and telling stills

0 you can taste it , but there's no fizz 
0 arguably the year's silliest and most incoherent movie 
1 morton uses her face and her body language to bring us morvern's soul , even though the character is almost completely deadpan 
1 the script is smart and dark hallelujah for small favors 
1 he has a great cast and a great idea 
0 the idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not very funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run 
1 if you enjoy more thoughtful comedies with interesting conflicted characters this one is for you 
1 the movie is very funny as you peek at it through the fingers in front of your eyes 
1 an enjoyable film for the family , amusing and cute for both adults and kids 
1 the entire cast is extraordinarily good 
1 it's a treat a delightful , witty , improbable romantic comedy with a zippy jazzy score grant and bullock make it look as though they are having so much fun 
1 there is a strong directorial stamp on every frame of this stylish film that is able to visualize schizophrenia but is still confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye 
0 an almost unbearably morbid love story 
1 excellent acting and direction 
1 it's pretty linear and only makeup deep , but bogdanovich ties it together with efficiency and an affection for the period 
1 i love the robust middle of this picture
