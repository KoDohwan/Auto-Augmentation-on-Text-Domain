1 fluffy and disposible 
1 if the title is a jeopardy question , then the answer might be `` how does steven seagal come across these days ?' 
4 exquisitely nuanced in mood tics and dialogue , this chamber drama is superbly acted by the deeply appealing veteran bouquet and the chilling but quite human berling

4 there is a refreshing absence of cynicism in stuart little quite a rarity , even in the family film market 
2 only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass murdering since but has never been seen doing laundry 
3 succeeds as a well made evocation of a subculture 
2 the message is that even the most unlikely can link together to conquer all kinds of obstacles , whether they be of nature , of man or of one another 
4 congrats disney on a job well done , i enjoyed it just as much ! 
1 even if it made its original release date last fall , it would've reeked of a been there , done that sameness 
3 intriguing and beautiful film , but those of you who read the book are likely to be disappointed 
3 beating the austin powers films at their own game , this blaxploitation spoof downplays the raunch in favor of gags that rely on the strength of their own cleverness as opposed to the extent of their outrageousness 
2 melanie eventually slugs the yankee 
1 too much power , not enough puff 
2 returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters , sandler , who also executive produces , has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy 
1 what's worse is that pelosi knows it 
1 i can't say this enough this movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies 
2 one thing is for sure this movie does not tell you a whole lot about lily chou chou 
1 the beautiful images and solemn words can not disguise the slack complacency of lrb godard's rrb vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self righteousness of his voice 
1 imagine if you will a tony hawk skating video interspliced with footage from behind enemy lines and set to jersey shore techno 
2 a charming and funny story of clashing cultures and a clashing mother daughter relationship 
4 a venturesome , beautifully realized psychological mood piece that reveals its first time feature director's understanding of the expressive power of the camera 
3 the filmmakers want nothing else than to show us a good time , and in their cheap , b movie way , they succeed 
0 a minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless , witless , and devoid of anything resembling humor 
3 washington overcomes the script's flaws and envelops the audience in his character's anguish , anger and frustration 
4 it's a fine , focused piece of work that reopens an interesting controversy and never succumbs to sensationalism 
3 nohe's documentary about the event is sympathetic without being gullible he isn't blind to the silliness , but also captures moments of spontaneous creativity and authentic co operative interaction 
3 the picture uses humor and a heartfelt conviction to tell a story about discovering your destination in life , but also acknowledging the places , and the people , from whence you came 
4 somewhat blurred , but kinnear's performance is razor sharp 
0 after sitting through this sloppy , made for movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work 
1 an inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength 
1 arguably the year's silliest and most incoherent movie 
3 the observations of this social economic urban environment are canny and spiced with irony 
1 flat , misguided comedy 
3 some movies are like a tasty hors d'oeuvre this one is a feast 
1 enough is not a bad movie , just mediocre

1 it's hard to pity the ` plain girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip gloss 
4 lrb a rrb wonderfully loopy tale of love , longing , and voting 
3 this is popcorn movie fun with equal doses of action , cheese , ham and cheek lrb as well as a serious debt to the road warrior rrb , but it feels like unrealized potential

1 there's nothing remotely topical or sexy here 
1 for something as splendid looking as this particular film , the viewer expects something special but instead gets lrb sci fi rrb rehash 
0 unfortunately , the picture failed to capture me 
3 generates an enormous feeling of empathy for its characters 
4 victor rosa is leguizamo's best movie work so far , a subtle and richly internalized performance 
1 given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster this time , there isn't much 
3 richard gere and diane lane put in fine performances as does french actor oliver martinez 
3 if anything , see it for karen black , who camps up a storm as a fringe feminist conspiracy theorist named dirty dick 
2 narc can only remind us of brilliant crime dramas without becoming one itself 
2 morrissette's script and direction show a fair amount of intelligence and wit but it doesn't signify a whole lot either

3 unfolds in a series of achronological vignettes whose cumulative effect is chilling 
3 spielberg has managed to marry science fiction with film noir and action flicks with philosophical inquiry 
1 the fact that the ` best part of the movie comes from a second homage to one of demme's good films doesn't bode well for the rest of it 
3 very predictable but still entertaining 
2 alas , another breathless movie about same ! 
2 is clever enough , though thin writing proves its undoing 
4 brilliant ! 
2 maid in manhattan might not look so appealing on third or fourth viewing down the road but as a high concept vehicle for two bright stars of the moment who can rise to fans lofty expectations , the movie passes inspection 
1 however , it lacks grandeur and that epic quality often associated with stevenson's tale as well as with earlier disney efforts 
4 just about the surest bet for an all around good time at the movies this summer 
3 from spiritual rebirth to bruising defeat , vincent's odyssey resonates in a profound way , comparable to the classic films of jean renoir 
3 it's about issues most adults have to face in marriage and i think that's what i liked about it the real issues tucked between the silly and crude storyline 
3 a good documentary can make interesting a subject you thought would leave you cold 
1 in the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose tinted glasses 
4 a serious movie with serious ideas 
0 what might have been acceptable on the printed page of iles book does not translate well to the screen 
2 lrb the digital effects rrb reminded me of terry gilliam's rudimentary old monty python cartoons , in which he would cut out figures from drawings and photographs and paste them together 
1 davis is so enamored of her own creation that she can't see how insufferable the character is 
4 the kooky yet shadowy vision clooney sustains throughout is daring , inventive and impressive 
2 mocking kung fu pictures when they were a staple of exploitation theater programming was witty 
3 a big budget all star movie as unblinkingly pure as the hours is a distinct rarity , and an event 
1 a frantic search for laughs , with a hit to miss ratio that doesn't exactly favour the audience 
0 nothing in waking up in reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay 
1 cliches are as thick as the cigarette smoke 
0 a lackluster , unessential sequel to the classic disney adaptation of j m barrie's peter pan 
3 this rich , bittersweet israeli documentary , about the life of song and dance man pasach ` ke burstein and his family , transcends ethnic lines 
3 although some viewers will not be able to stomach so much tongue in cheek weirdness , those who do will have found a cult favorite to enjoy for a lifetime 
3 it's hard to imagine anybody ever being `` in the mood' to view a movie as harrowing and painful as the grey zone , but it's equally hard to imagine anybody being able to tear their eyes away from the screen once it's started 
3 mindless yet impressively lean spinoff of last summer's bloated effects fest the mummy returns 
1 this film is so slick , superficial and trend hoppy , that it's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay 
3 it's made with deftly unsettling genre flair 
1 everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones 
1 a tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already shallow genre 
3 by the end of it all i sort of loved the people onscreen , even though i could not stand them 
4 such master screenwriting comes courtesy of john pogue , the yale grad who previously gave us `` the skulls' and last year's `` rollerball '

2 or a profit 
3 blessed with two fine , nuanced lead performances 
2 to enjoy this movie's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by jolie and burns , you have to gloss over the no sense ending 
2 grown up quibbles are beside the point here 
1 based on a david leavitt story , the film shares that writer's usual blend of observant cleverness , too facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness 
4 the bard as black comedy willie would have loved it 
4 darkly funny and frequently insightful 
4 lrb director peter rrb jackson and his crew have so steeped themselves in the majesty of tolkien's writing that every frame produces new joys , whether you're a fan of the books or not 
2 some stunning visuals and some staggeringly boring cinema 
3 predictable storyline and by the book scripting is all but washed away by sumptuous ocean visuals and the cinematic stylings of director john stockwell 
4 no sophomore slump for director sam mendes , who segues from oscar winner to oscar winning potential with a smooth sleight of hand 
1 more successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine 
2 it may not be as cutting , as witty or as true as back in the glory days of weekend and two or three things i know about her , but who else engaged in filmmaking today is so cognizant of the cultural and moral issues involved in the process ? 
4 a strong first act and absolutely , inescapably gorgeous , skyscraper trapeze motion of the amazing spider man 
1 they felt like the same movie to me 
1 the chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film 
3 it's surprisingly decent , particularly for a tenth installment in a series 
0 it's a road trip drama with too many wrong turns 
1 the low budget full frontal was one of the year's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self indulgent pictures , and solaris is its big budget brother 
2 open minded kids kids who read , kids who dream will be comforted by the way it deals with big issues like death and destiny 
1 resident evil isn't a product of its cinematic predecessors so much as an mtv , sugar hysteria , and playstation cocktail

2 a sterling film a cross between boys don't cry , deliverance , and ode to billy joe lies somewhere in the story of matthew shepard , but that film is yet to be made 
2 many of benjamins elements feel like they've been patched in from an episode of miami vice 
2 however clever nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release 
1 you can practically smell the patchouli oil 
0 de niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to clint eastwood in the lazy bloodwork 
3 aside from rohmer's bold choices regarding point of view , the lady and the duke represents the filmmaker's lifelong concern with formalist experimentation in cinematic art 
3 a tender , heartfelt family drama 
0 poor ben bratt couldn't find stardom if mapquest emailed him point to point driving directions 
3 as a thoughtful and unflinching examination of an alternative lifestyle , sex with strangers is a success 
4 the film brilliantly shines on all the characters , as the direction is intelligently accomplished 
3 criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes my big fat greek wedding look like an apartheid drama 
1 narratively , trouble every day is a plodding mess 
2 it's the perfect kind of film to see when you don't want to use your brain 
1 shows holmes has the screen presence to become a major league leading lady , lrb but rrb the movie itself is an underachiever , a psychological mystery that takes its sweet time building to a climax that's scarcely a surprise by the time it arrives 
1 it's quite diverting nonsense 
3 watching scarlet diva , one is poised for titillation , raw insight or both 
0 the ending is a cop out 
4 if you're looking for something new and hoping for something entertaining , you're in luck 
3 the stunt work is top notch the dialogue and drama often food spittingly funny 
3 `` frailty' has been written so well , that even a simple `` goddammit !' 
1 but daphne , you're too buff fred thinks he's tough and velma wow , you've lost weight ! 
3 it's not going to be everyone's bag of popcorn , but it definitely gives you something to chew on 
0 but like bruce springsteen's gone to pot asbury park , new jersey , this sad sack waste of a movie is a city of ruins 
3 with we were soldiers , hollywood makes a valiant attempt to tell a story about the vietnam war before the pathology set in 
3 reminiscent of alfred hitchcock's thrillers , most of the scary parts in ` signs occur while waiting for things to happen 
2 apart from its own considerable achievement , metropolis confirms tezuka's status as both the primary visual influence on the anim tradition and its defining philosophical conscience 
2 the biggest problem with this movie is that it's not nearly long enough 
0 becomes a bit of a mishmash a tearjerker that doesn't and a thriller that won't 
1 isn't it a bit early in his career for director barry sonnenfeld to do a homage to himself ? 
2 it arrives with an impeccable pedigree , mongrel pep , and almost indecipherable plot complications 
4 the best didacticism is one carried by a strong sense of humanism , and bertrand tavernier's oft brilliant safe conduct lrb `` laissez passer' rrb wears its heart on its sleeve 
4 the mesmerizing performances of the leads keep the film grounded and keep the audience riveted 
3 birthday girl is an amusing joy ride , with some surprisingly violent moments 
3 a polished and vastly entertaining caper film that puts the sting back into the con 
0 a tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid 
1 even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame 
4 it's the kind of movie that , aside from robert altman , spike lee , the coen brothers and a few others , our moviemakers don't make often enough 
2 but it doesn't need gangs of new york 
4 this film puts wang at the forefront of china's sixth generation of film makers 
2 while holm is terrific as both men and hjejle quite appealing , the film fails to make the most out of the intriguing premise 
1 the locale remains far more interesting than the story at hand 
3 tailored to entertain ! 
4 a hugely rewarding experience that's every bit as enlightening , insightful and entertaining as grant's two best films four weddings and a funeral and bridget jones's diary 
0 there's nothing to gain from watching they 
1 the film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil 
1 the movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the `` webcast ' 
0 the original wasn't a good movie but this remake makes it look like a masterpiece ! 
3 achieves a sort of filmic epiphany that revels in the true potential of the medium 
3 this is a more fascinating look at the future than `` bladerunner' and one of the most high concept sci fi adventures attempted for the screen 
2 the problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , mr desplechin is content to state it 
3 lee jeong hyang tells it so lovingly and films it so beautifully that i couldn't help being captivated by it 
4 unpretentious , charming , quirky , original 
3 if the film fails to fulfill its own ambitious goals , it nonetheless sustains interest during the long build up of expository material 
2 it may not be history but then again , what if it is ? 
1 while this film has an ` a list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale like its central figure , vivi is just a little bit hard to love 
3 like its parade of predecessors , this halloween is a gory slash fest 
4 warm water under a red bridge is a quirky and poignant japanese film that explores the fascinating connections between women , water , nature , and sexuality 
0 the emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down 
3 a bilingual charmer , just like the woman who inspired it 
3 despite its flaws belinsky is still able to create an engaging story that keeps you guessing at almost every turn 
4 it's a masterpeice 
1 a graceless , witless attempt at mating some like it hot with the wwii espionage thriller 
2 anyone who's ever suffered under a martinet music instructor has no doubt fantasized about what an unhappy , repressed and twisted personal life their tormentor deserved 
1 the stories here suffer from the chosen format 
4 sensitive ensemble performances and good period reconstruction add up to a moving tragedy with some buoyant human moments 
1 will anyone who isn't a fangoria subscriber be excited that it hasn't gone straight to video ? 
1 it's also heavy handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views 
4 deliriously funny , fast and loose , accessible to the uninitiated , and full of surprises 
1 schneidermeister makin a fool of himself losin his fan base 
3 even if you don't understand what on earth is going on , this is a movie that will stimulate hours of post viewing discussion , if only to be reminded of who did what to whom and why 
2 so verbally flatfooted and so emotionally predictable or bland that it plays like the standard made for tv movie 
3 on its own staggeringly unoriginal terms , this gender bending comedy is generally quite funny 
3 campanella gets the tone just right funny in the middle of sad in the middle of hopeful 
0 a so so , made for tv something posing as a real movie 
4 a riveting story well told 
3 as bundy , michael reilly burke lrb octopus river of fear rrb has just the right amount of charisma and menace 
3 as much as i laughed throughout the movie , i can not mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys superhuman capacity to withstand pain 
4 some movies suck you in despite their flaws , and heaven is one such beast 
3 there are no special effects , and no hollywood endings 
2 it just doesn't have much else especially in a moral sense 
4 as a singular character study , it's perfect 
2 the film is darkly atmospheric , with herrmann quietly suggesting the sadness and obsession beneath hearst's forced avuncular chortles 
0 many went to see the attraction for the sole reason that it was hot outside and there was air conditioning inside , and i don't think that a c will help this movie one bit 
1 there's some outrageously creative action in the transporter lrb b rrb ut by the time frank parachutes down onto a moving truck , it's just another cartoon with an unstoppable superman 
1 outside of burger's desire to make some kind of film , it's really unclear why this project was undertaken 
4 the year's happiest surprise , a movie that deals with a real subject in an always surprising way 
1 taken individually or collectively , the stories never add up to as much as they promise 
2 you just know something terrible is going to happen 
1 even with its million us budget , pinocchio never quite achieves the feel of a fanciful motion picture 
3 instead of hitting the audience over the head with a moral , schrader relies on subtle ironies and visual devices to convey point of view 
0 sets animation back years , musicals back years and judaism back at least 
4 the hard to predict and absolutely essential chemistry between the down to earth bullock and the nonchalant grant proves to be sensational , and everything meshes in this elegant entertainment 
3 in visual fertility treasure planet rivals the top japanese animations of recent vintage 
3 an eccentric little comic thriller deeply in love with its own quirky personality 
1 extreme oops oops , ops , no matter how you spell it , it's still a mistake to go see it 
0 two hours of junk 
4 what makes how i killed my father compelling , besides its terrific performances , is fontaine's willingness to wander into the dark areas of parent child relationships without flinching 
2 director david jacobson gives dahmer a consideration that the murderer never game his victims 
1 if oscar had a category called best bad film you thought was going to be really awful but wasn't , guys would probably be duking it out with the queen of the damned for the honor 
2 the vintage is pure , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message fatal attraction don't have an affair with a nutjob unfaithful don't if you're married to one 
0 kirshner and monroe seem to be in a contest to see who can out bad act the other 
1 the cast portrays their cartoon counterparts well but quite frankly , scoob and shag don't eat enough during the film 
1 any film that doesn't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss 
1 although made on a shoestring and unevenly acted , conjures a lynch like vision of the rotting underbelly of middle america
